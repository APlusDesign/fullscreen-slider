Fullscreen fluid background gallery slider

Demo v.0.1.1

www.aplusdesign.com.au/demos/fullscreen-slider



###Is this another slider O_o

Not really. 


###WHY is it different

There are no free or commercial products that allow you to basically use the entire document space as your slider that handle large background imagery properly!

All the sliders I looked at load your images at the beginning and really destroy the user experience, imagine loading 5, 1mb images while your users stare at a blank screen, then the user never clicks the links that show them? Pretty silly right!



###Fullscreen-slider

Use super large awesome looking backgrounds

Never worry about scaling of your background images on fluid layouts

Graceful UI that handles image loading logically

Lots of public methods that let you control the slider outside of the plugin itself.


###It's free

So enjoy! :)
